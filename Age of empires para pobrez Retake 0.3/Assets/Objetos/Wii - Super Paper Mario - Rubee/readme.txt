Game: Super Paper Mario
Subject: Rubee

Model ripped by Fawfulthegreat64.
Huge thanks to Diagamma for the Blender plugin that made these rips possible.

Notes:

Colored in-game using vertex colors. The vertex color data is included in the model, however it is not calculated the same way in 3D software as it is in the game (and Blender doesn't render this data by default), so a version where the color data is converted to a texture is also included.
